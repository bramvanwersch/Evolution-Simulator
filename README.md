# EvolutionaryGame
A rough programme that aims to simulate evolution of genetic information trough the visual simulation of species interacting whit a very
basic enviornment. Each species has an individual genome. A pool of genes is pre determined. This is neccesairy to be able to have species
evolve new genes. Idealy there would be a different solution for this in the future.
To read the data files and get some usefull information out of it i wrote some python scripts that have to stil be intergrated.
There are 3 species available herbivore, carnivore and omnivore. 

## Working on:
- At the moment i am working on making an option interface to easily configure the game instead of changing hard coded values.
- Also see ToDo.txt under the data tab.
