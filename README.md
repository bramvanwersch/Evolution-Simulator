# EvolutionaryGame
A rough program that aims to simulate evolution of genetic information through the visual simulation of species interacting with a very
basic enviroment. Each species has an individual genome. A pool of genes is pre-determined. This is necessary to be able to have species
evolve new genes. Ideally there would be a different solution for this in the future.
To read the data files and get some useful information out of it I wrote some python scripts that have to stil be intergrated.
There are 3 species available herbivore, carnivore and omnivore.
