# EvolutionaryGame
A rough programme that aims to simulate evolution of genetic information trough the visual simulation of species interacting whit a very
basic enviornment. Each species has an individual genome. A pool of genes is pre determined. This is neccesairy to be able to have species
evolve new genes. Idealy there would be a different solution for this in the future.
To read the data files and get some usefull information out of it i wrote some python scripts that have to stil be intergrated.
There are 3 species available herbivore, carnivore and omnivore. 

## Working on:
- At the moment i am working on making an option interface to easily configure the game instead of changing hard coded values.
- add genomes to plants
- make non essential genes
- make more genes
- fix predators being smaller then prey
- make predators more viable
- fix chase mechanic
- fix either energy consumption droppign to zero for a frame or species having zero energy consumption for a frame
- fix species standing still for no reason.
- fix species count going from 0 to 2. There is no species 1
- give predators an ability to eat species bigger then themselves. --> give it a cap.
